									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
									<p>
										Hi there! I'm Thesya Evania Gabrielle, but you can call me Thesya
									</p>
									<p>
										A data and technology enthusiast that likes to explore and learn new things!
									</p>
									<p>
										Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computing Science (Honours) majoring in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence
										at University of Technology Sydney. As technology innovation emerged, I became passionate about learning data and artificial intelligence. 
										I realised the power of data to reveal new insights and unlock a new understanding of data. 
										Moreover, I discovered how artificial intelligence and the use of data can help humans 
										in many different sectorsâ€”unlocking new experiences that we never imagined before.
									</p>
									<p>
										For me, data is like a puzzle. When each piece is by itself, it seems to be uncorrelated numbers. 
										However, when we explore deeper and generate visualisation, we see patterns and trends, get insights and make predictions. 
										On the other hand, AI always fascinates me with its fast evolve. Learning and building AI algorithms challenges me 
										to think creatively about how we can embed AI to solve our everyday problems.                                        
										For me, AI is not a robot that can rule the world one day; it is simply there to eliminate our tedious task for us to explore other things.
									</p>
									<p>
										When I am not studying, I like to play musical instruments and build plastic models. Since I was a kid, I like to learn new things especially musical intruments.
										Starting off by learning piano at the age of 4, I begin to develop my interest in music. Soon, I started learning drums and guitar in junior high school and always
										explore more techniques and genre in my free time. I am most interested in drums as there are endless possibilities of pattern that I can perform, which always
										challenges me to improve my creativity. 
									</p>
									<p>
										That's all about me and I'd love to connect with you! Feel free to explore this website and contact me!
