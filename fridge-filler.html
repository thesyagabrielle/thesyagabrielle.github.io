												<h3>Use Case</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												In a busy life, shopping list is consider not an important things to remember. People tend forgot to update their shopping list
												when their ingredients have run out and kept on forgoting to buy them. On the other hand, people also overbought products that they have bought before
												as they forgot to update their shopping list. This has led to massive amount of food waste. Food waste has a significant negative environmental impacts
												and this project aims to help reduce them.
											</p>

												<h3>Aims</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This project aims to create an automatic shopping list by embedding object detection in a mobile application allowing use to 
												scan their fridge and detect objects inside their fridge easier than before. It also updates missing items and store it into the shopping list.
											</p>

												<h3>About the app</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												This application is an mobile application. Firstly, user need to sign in and sign up for an account. This account will be used to store the list of
												things in the fridge. The data will then be stored in a cloud database. In the main screen of the app we have out list, add button, and shopping list button. 
												To create a list, we can click the add button, which will opens up our camera. The camera have an object detection algorithmns on it. It will then detect the object 
												inside the firgde, and then we can add the list. We can create another list using the add button. Then, we can view the list by clicking the list box, it will show 
												the list and there will be a button to update the list. Once we update the list, the app will check the missing items, and we are able to add the missing items into the 
												shopping list. To open up the shopping list, we just click the cart button.

												<h3>Take away</h3>

											<p>
												In build this project for Deep learning subject with 2 of my other team members. We build the dataset together and annotate them using CVAT.
												In this project I mostly work on the GUI. Creating a mobile application using Java language in Android Studio. I learn to integrate machine learning algorithmn 
												into a mobile application. To integrate the app, we compile the baseline of the machine learning algorithm into a tensor flow model, which is embedded
												into the mobile application. I also learn how to use cloud database, such as Firebase, learning to store and receive informations. Through this project, I have enhance
												my skills in building machine learning algorithm such as Yolov5, building an android mobile application and integrating object detection and cloud database.
